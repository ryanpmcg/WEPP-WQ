# WEPP-WQ
The Water Erosion Prediction Project Water Quality (WEPP-WQ) Model

WEPP-WQ is a derivative of WEPP and SWAT models in which daily nonpoint source (NPS) pollutant simulation routines from SWAT v2012 were adapted to a WEPP framework for simulating chemical sourcing and transport in nonuniform hillslopes.

## Current Version
Version 2022.05.10 is the most recent model version.

## Source Code Availability
WEPP-WQ was developed in partnership with USDA-ARS at the National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory using proprietary Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) source code. At this time, WEPP source code has not been made open-source. Despite this limitation, WEPP-WQ source files which are not associated with the original source code are made open-source in keeping with the arrangement with USDA-ARS.

## Executable Availability
In addition, a Windows executable file is provided for general use of the model.

## Support
Only WEPP-WQ related issues are supported.

## Issues
To report a potential bug, suggest an improvement, or raise other points to the community, please open an issue. If there is a problem, please provide the following:
1. Your OS and applicable hardware limitations
2. Your WEPP-WQ command
3. Your input files in a single .zip file
5. Your output (if there is any) and the correct output (if applicable)

## Conduct
Do not let this become an issue. Obviously poor conduct will result in a ban.

## Dependencies
WEPP-WQ is completely original code and contains no dependencies.
