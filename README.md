# WEPP-WQ
The Water Erosion Prediction Project Water Quality (WEPP-WQ) Model

WEPP-WQ is a derivative of WEPP and SWAT models in which daily nonpoint source (NPS) pollutant simulation routines from SWAT v2012 were adapted to a WEPP framework for simulating chemical sourcing and transport in nonuniform hillslopes.

The single greatest benefit of this new model development project is the ability to simulate chemical transport in multiple overland flow element (OFE) cases in a WEPP simulation (i.e., a nonuniform hillslope). Please see the accompanying peer-reviewed paper for more details, which will be added here once published.

## Current Version and Contents
Version 2022.05.10 is the most recent model version.
+ BUILD - contains executable versions of WEPP-WQ
+ DATA - contains all validation data pertaining to WEPP-WQ validations for the purposes of transparency and accountability
+ SRC - contains all source code files related to WEPP-WQ not restricted from open-source publication

## Source Code Availability
WEPP-WQ was developed in partnership with USDA-ARS at the National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory using proprietary Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) source code. At this time, WEPP source code has not been made open-source. Despite this limitation, WEPP-WQ source files which are not associated with the original source code are made open-source in maintaining the most collaborative position possible within these project constraints.

## Executable Availability
In addition, a Windows executable file is provided for general use of the model. Over time, if WEPP-WQ users have need of a particular executable or configuration for troubleshooting or developing their own extensions based on this framework, I will be happy to accommodate those requests.

## Support
Only WEPP-WQ related issues are supported.

## Issues
To report a potential bug, suggest an improvement, or raise other points to the community, please open an issue. If there is a problem, please provide the following:
1. Your OS and applicable hardware limitations
2. Your WEPP-WQ command
3. Your input files in a single .zip file
5. Your output (if there is any) and the correct output (if applicable)

## Conduct
Do not let this become an issue. Obviously poor conduct will result in a ban.

## Dependencies
Aside from WEPP and SWAT source code upon which WEPP-WQ is built, all code is the original work of Ryan P. McGehee and contains no dependencies. A peer-review article is currently in the review process which details what modifications were made in this project.
